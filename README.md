<h1 align="center"> Hi there! I'm Daniel 👋</h1>


<h4 align="center"> 
I'm a technology student in Multiplatform Software Development at Fatec Itaquera, and a Node.js and Python enthusiast. I'm in the first year of graduation, acquiring solid knowledge in algorithms, programming and data structures. My focus is on software development, especially on Back-End. I am currently looking for an internship opportunity or part-time job to delve deeper into software development, learn from experienced professionals, and contribute my technical skills. In my free time I like to work on personal projects and read books.
